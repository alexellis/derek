## Contributing

### Guidelines

Here are a few guidelines for contributing:

* If you would like to contribute to the codebase **please raise an issue to propose the change**
* Do not mix feature changes or fixes with refactoring - it makes the code harder to review and means there is more for the maintainers (with limited time) to test

* If you have found a bug please raise an issue and fill out the whole template.
* Don't raise PRs for typos, these aren't necessary - just raise an Issue
* If the documentation can be improved / translated etc please raise an issue to discuss. 

* Please always provide a summary of what you changed, how you did it and how it can be tested.
