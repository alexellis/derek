It's derek ![](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/in/4385?v=4&u=55bb4ce982675cb17680b7215e7e0d024b549324&s=24). Nice to meet you. I'd like to help you with Pull Requests and Issues on your GitHub project.

## What can I do?

* Check that commits are signed-off

When someone sends a PR without a sign-off, I'll apply a label `no-dco` and also send them a comment pointing them to the contributor guide. Most of the time when I've been helping the OpenFaaS project - people read my message and fix things up without you having to get involved.

* Allow users in a specified MAINTAINERS file to apply comments to issues

You don't have to give people full write access anymore to help you manage issues. I'll do that for you, just put them in a MAINTAINERS file in the root and when they comment on an issue then I'll use my granular permissions instead.

Example:

```
Derek add label: awesome
```

## How do I work?

I'm designed to be installed as a [GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-github-apps/), but don't worry - I don't need a lot of permissions. Just access to issues and Pull Requests will do.

I'm not a long-running daemon.. I'd get bored that way. I work with webhooks - so stick me in a serverless framework like [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/alexellis/faas) and forget about me. Just apply oil from time to time.

This is me in action! Normally contributors edit and re-push within a few minutes after re-reading the contribution guide.

*Inspiration for Derek*

The idea for a bot that could comment on issues or respond to activity is from the docker/docker or Moby project's bot called [Poule](https://github.com/icecrime/poule). It's a much more complex long-running daemon which uses Personal Access Tokens (so needs to run as a full GitHub login). Derek is much simpler (so hackable) and can be installed with granular permissions.

### Where is Derek working now?

Derek is active and operating 24/7 helping the OpenFaaS project!

* http://github.com/alexellis/faas-netes

* http://github.com/alexellis/faas-cli

## Get your own Derek robot

* Setup [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/alexellis/openfaas) and the `faas-cli`

* Now get your publically-available URL for OpenFaaS (or one punched out with an ngrok.io tunnel)

* Install Derek as a Github app and get your private key, save it as "derek.pem" and put it into the auth folder.

### Configure Docker image:

We have to build a Docker image with your .pem file included

We'll also set the symmetric key or secret that you got from GitHub as the `secret_key` environmental variable. Validating via a symmetric key is also known as HMAC. If you want to turn this off (to edit and debug) then set `validate_hmac="false"`

Fill out the `application` variable with the ID of the registered Derek Github App, and the `installation` variable with the installation ID you got when adding Derek to your account.

Set the following in your Dockerfile

```
ENV secret_key="docker"
ENV application=4385
ENV installation=45362
ENV private_key="derek.pem"

ENV validate_hmac="true"
```

Now, build and deploy Derek:

```
$ docker build -t derek .
$ faas-cli -action build -name derek -image derek -fprocess=./derek
```

**Testing**

Create a label of "no-dco" within every project you want Derek to help you with.

Head over to your GitHub repository and raise a Pull Request from the web-UI for your README file. This will not sign-off the commit, so you'll have Derek on your case.
