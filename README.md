It's derek ![](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/in/4385?v=4&u=55bb4ce982675cb17680b7215e7e0d024b549324&s=24). Nice to meet you. I'd like to help you with Pull Requests and Issues on your GitHub project.

> Please show support for the project and **Star** the repo.

## What can I do?

* Check that commits are signed-off

When someone sends a PR without a sign-off, I'll apply a label `no-dco` and also send them a comment pointing them to the contributor guide. Most of the time when I've been helping the OpenFaaS project - people read my message and fix things up without you having to get involved.

* Allow users in a specified MAINTAINERS file to manage issues and pull-requests

You don't have to give people full write access anymore to help you manage issues and pull-requests. I'll do that for you, just put them in a MAINTAINERS file in the root and when they comment on an issue then I'll use my granular permissions instead.

> Note that the assign/unassign commands provides the shortcut `me` to assign to the commenter

Example:

* Labels

```
Derek add label: awesome
Derek remove label: awesome
```

* Assign work

```
Derek assign: alexellis
Derek unassign: me
```

* Manage issues and PRs

```
Derek close
Derek reopen 
```

Coming soon
* [x] Derek as a managed GitHub App
* [ ] Lock thread
* [ ] Edit title
* [x] Toggle the DCO-feature

## How do I work?

I'm designed to be installed as a [GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-github-apps/), but don't worry - I don't need a lot of permissions. Just access to issues and Pull Requests will do.

I'm not a long-running daemon.. I'd get bored that way. I work with webhooks - so stick me in a serverless framework like [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/alexellis/faas) and forget about me. Just apply oil from time to time.

This is me in action! Normally contributors edit and re-push within a few minutes after re-reading the contribution guide.

*Inspiration for Derek*

The idea for a bot that could comment on issues or respond to activity is from the docker/docker or Moby project's bot called [Poule](https://github.com/icecrime/poule). It's a much more complex long-running daemon which uses Personal Access Tokens (so needs to run as a full GitHub login). Derek is much simpler (so hackable) and can be installed with granular permissions.

### Where is Derek working now?

### Maintainers

* Alex Ellis - author
* Richard Gee (@rgee0) - co-maintainer
* John Mccabe (@johnmccabe) - co-maintainer

Alex Ellis created Derek to automate project maintainer duties around licensing and to help bring granular permissions back to GitHub. Derek has empowered contributors in the OpenFaaS community to run and maintain the project without needing full write access. OpenFaaS contributors continue to improve Derek so they can get the job done without fuss.
